# `> Hello, World!` :wave:

I am _Ramon_, a PhD candidate in Computational Intelligence at the [Industrial and Systems Engineering Graduate Program - PUCPR](https://www.pucpr.br/escola-politecnica/industrial-and-systems/) :mortar_board: and Data Scientist at [Banco Bradesco](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bradesco/) :moneybag::man_technologist:. 

I've been researching on applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches for time series forecasting :chart_with_upwards_trend:. Some applications of forecasting in diverse datasets, such as: Wind energy of a turbine in a wind farm in Brazil [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544220322817), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061522005051)]; COVID-19 cases in Brazil and USA context coupled with meteorological variables [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960077920304252)]; Supply chain management (retail sales) [[4](https://sbic.org.br/eventos/cbic_2021/cbic2021-25/)]; and Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) price over time [[5](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9207152)].
