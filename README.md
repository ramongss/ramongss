# `> Hello, World!` :wave:

I am _Ramon G. da Silva_, PhD student in the [Industrial and Systems Engineering Graduate Program - PUCPR](https://www.pucpr.br/escola-politecnica/industrial-and-systems/) :mortar_board:, and Data Scientist at [Hilab (HealthTech Startup)](https://hilab.com.br/en/) :man_health_worker:. 

I've been researching on applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to time series forecasting :chart_with_upwards_trend:. Some applications of forecasting in diverse datasets, such as: [Wind energy of a turbine in a wind farm in Brazil](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544220322817); [COVID-19 cases in Brazil and USA context coupled with meteorological variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960077920304252); and [Cryptocurrecy (Bitcoin) price over time](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9207152).
