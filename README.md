# :wave: `> Hello, World!`

I am **Ramon**, a Ph.D. in Computational Intelligence from the [Industrial and Systems Engineering Graduate Program at PUCPR](https://www.pucpr.br/escola-politecnica/industrial-and-systems/) :mortar_board: and currently working as a Data Scientist at [Banco Bradesco](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bradesco/) :moneybag::man_technologist:.

### :page_with_curl: Research Focus

My research focuses on applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to time series forecasting :chart_with_upwards_trend:. I've worked on a variety of use cases, including:

- **Wind Energy Forecasting** in Brazilian wind farms [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544220322817), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061522005051)].
- **COVID-19 Case Forecasting** with meteorological data in Brazil and the USA [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960077920304252)].
- **Retail Sales Forecasting** for supply chain management [[4](https://sbic.org.br/eventos/cbic_2021/cbic2021-25/)].
